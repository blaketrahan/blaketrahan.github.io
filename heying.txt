This is the fifth Reading List I’ve posted, and it will, I imagine, be the most contentious.

The first (from March 2018) has 12 science books; the second (from May 2018) has 4 ethnographic books; the third (from May 2020) has 7 science fiction and fantasy novels; the fourth (also from May 2020) has 8 science fiction short stories. This list is different still.

This list includes several books and essays that I have mentioned on the Dark Horse Podcast in recent months (episode in which we discussed the text noted in those cases). Some of these I have read, or re-read, recently; in other cases, it has been decades. The list includes history and philosophy and fiction, both dead serious and satirical, and touches on time, and memory, and resistance; emotion and manipulation and truth. I think it an important list, and also an incomplete one, which is a strange assessment, as its goals are vague. How can something with no clear mission be incomplete? Perhaps I am trying to form something that is still amorphous, which I haven’t quite seen, but am sensing, feeling my way around the edges, seeking its boundaries. If you like, add suggestions to add to the list in the comments.
