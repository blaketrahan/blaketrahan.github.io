-----------------------------

Foods that DONT

Milk (lactose?) & Raw Milk -> gas, bloating, bad mood, acne

Whole orange -> Bloating, but I've never eaten a fresh orange I think

Chocolate - sometimes it just doesnt feel right, I can usually tell as soon as I take a bite whether it will be good for me or not.

-----------------------------

Uncertain

Haagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice cream -> Might be the high cream to milk ratio that makes this ok

Frozen fruit in general: blueberries, strawberries -> Feel like these cause gas

-----------------------------

Foods I want to try

Heavy cream (pasteurized and raw)

A green (spinach, collard greens)

Potato
