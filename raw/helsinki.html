  <h4>Helsinki</h4>
  <article>
<p>I like looking at my laptop while sitting on the floor of this quiet house in Helsinki. It’s just me and my computer—and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>I feel at home when I’m on my computer, and especially when I’m on the internet. Yes, home is the right word. The internet brings me home.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago I started traveling indefinitely. I left the apartment to my ex, then I stumbled into a few countries and continents before arriving in Helsinki. I don’t get paid much, but since I pay lodging and train tickets rather than rent and utilities, it’s enough. All I need is the internet, and I’m able to make it work. At least a mediocre connection and I’m okay. More than okay, because it’s me and my computer. It’s exactly as I want.</p>
