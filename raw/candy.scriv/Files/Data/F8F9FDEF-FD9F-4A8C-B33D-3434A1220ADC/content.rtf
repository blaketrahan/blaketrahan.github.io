\f0\fs30 \cf2 I\'92ve tried to write this story many times. Writing about real people in my life is hard. A diary should be brutal, but these stories are private between the characters, not just mine, they\'92re shared aren\'92t they?\
Every few months since 2017 I try to rewrite this, and I just want to be free of it, I\'92m trying to condense the last decade of my life into a few short words, whether or not it\'92s good or even understandable. None of that matters when I\'92m communicating.}
