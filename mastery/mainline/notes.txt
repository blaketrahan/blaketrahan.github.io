counterline
 
gerome talks about main line somewhere
 
mainline or equivalent or similarin eastern art
 
symmetrical vs asymmettrical
 
3d
 
--
 
 
all the basic mainlines (like plots)
 
all the counter lines
 
all the combinations of mainlines to counterlines
 
Can I catalogue every known mainline-counterline system?
 
picture examples
 
 
 
====================================
 
 
 
 

Rubens - rape of the sabine women

  Spiral - Top View & 2D Orientation - Arms counterlines sucked into - Specific: Vortex

Gerome - Bashi-Bazouk
 
  Spiral - Front View & 3D Upside Down Orientation - Sticks counterline sucked into - Specific: Vortex
 
    strong third dimension
 
 
Hokusai - Kajikazawa in Kai Province
 
  Wedge - Empathetic drifting into Horizon counterline
 
 
Money - Seine
 
  Wave - Symmetrical - Horizon counterline also functioning as axis of symmetry
 
 
Gerome - Truth Coming Out of Her Well
Gerome - Cock Fight
 
  Meridians & Parallels - Slight third dimension - longer lines (meridians, longitude, horizontal run) serving as main

Gerome - King Candaules
Gerome - The Duel
 
  Meridians & Parallels - Slight third dimension - shorter lines (parallels, latitude, vertical run) serving as main
 
Gerome - Prayer in the Mosque 
  Lattice - Strong, emphasized third dimension - lines traveling in serving as main 
  perspective functioning as main and counter lines
 
Gerome - Leaving the Oasis
 
  Waves with stick counterlines

Mainline
 
  Spiral
    Vortex - Mainline chaotic inward pull on counterline
    Staircase - Counterlines coexist on the mainline
 
  Wave
 
  Wedge
 
  Meridians & Parallels - have a sphere-like shrinking and growing
 
  Lattice - 2d or 3d lines intersecting regularly, not shrinking or growing
 

Counterlines
 
  Sticks - short lines that wobble / have a dominant direction but lots of irregularity

  Arms - Wedge as a counterline - by being secondary to mainline it doesnt have the same splitting effect on the picture
 
  Lattice, Meridians & Parallels minor lines

  (?) Wave counterline?
  (?) Spiral counterline?

  Mass - see homer fishing in boat - not line based but a mass with a direction

  Mainline

  Counterline
 
  Empathetic
 
  Symmetry
 
  Axis of Symmetry
 
  Orientation (3D)
 
  Drift, transformation
 
  Rhythm / timing - things are the lines or happen at intersections to counterlines
 
 
 



wedge / peak - point is emphasis

wave - whole line is emphasis

this is why vermeer is a wave

pyramid can be Peak type or Wave type (see hunter)

emphasis seems different

see ukiyo-e pyramid on wiki
